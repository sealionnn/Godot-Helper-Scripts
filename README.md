Feel free to use these scripts in your projects. If you use these, you can credit "Tampopo Interactive Media" if you feel inclined (and include the Youtube link below if you want). Some of the code in these scripts is not my own, and I credit the creators accordingly. Please credit them if you use their code.

PS: These could use a bit of editing, but I wanted to get them posted early so that viewers have access to these to follow along more easily with my tutorials without copying all of the functions I use.
